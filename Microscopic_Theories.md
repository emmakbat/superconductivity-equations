Valid near $T_c$.

(1) $\frac{1}{2m*}(-i\hbar \vec{\nabla} - e^* \vec{A})^2 \Psi + \alpha \Psi + \beta |\Psi|^2 \Psi = 0$

(2) $-\vec{\nabla}^2 \frac{\vec{A}}{\mu_0} = \vec{J_s} = \frac{e^{* 2}}{m^* } [-\vec{A}|\Psi|^2 + \frac{i\hbar}{2e^* } (\Psi^* \vec{\nabla}\Psi - \Psi \vec{\nabla}\Psi^* )]$

where $\alpha/\beta = |\Psi_0|^2$ and $\alpha^2/\beta = \mu_0 H_c^2$

Equation (2) reduces to the 2nd London Equation if the phase of $\Psi$ is uniform.

Also important is the Ginzburg-Landau free energy [2], which gives the free-energy density of the superconducting state as a function of the above defined variables.

(3) $f = f_{n0}+ \alpha |\Psi|^2+ \frac{\beta}{2} |\Psi|^4+ \frac{1}{2 m*} |(\frac{\hbar}{i} \nabla - \frac{e*}{c} \mathbf{A}) \Psi|^2 + \frac{h^2}{8 \pi}$

If $\Psi =0$, then this reduces to the free energy of the normal state, i.e. the contributions of the first and last terms. The fourth term gives the contributions from gradients and from the electromagnetic field. Without these effects, the energy difference between the superconducting state and the normal state is:

(4) $f_s - f_n = \alpha |\Psi|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \beta |\Psi|^4$

The reason GL theory only works near $T_c$ is because this expansion is sufficient only where the order parameter is small, i.e. where $\beta > 0$. If $\alpha >0$ then free energy is minimized where $|\Psi|^2 = 0$, i.e. in the normal state. If $\alpha < 0$ then the minimum occurs where $|\Psi|^2 = -\alpha/\beta$, which when substituted into the free energy equation yields 
$\frac{-H_c^2}{8\pi} = \frac{-\alpha^2}{2\beta}$, hence the above definitions.

- $n_s = |\Psi|^2 = \Delta(x)$ and $e* = 2e$ allows derivation of G-L from BCS
