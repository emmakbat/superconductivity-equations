## Energy Gap

The energy gap betweent the superconducting and normal ground states $2\Delta$ is one of
the fundamental features of BCS superconductivity. It is related to $T_c$, which in turn
predicts the temperature dependence of many other important material properties of 
superconductors.

$$ \Delta(T \rightarrow 0) = 1.764 k_b T_c $$

$$ \Delta(T \rightarrow T_c) = 3.06 k_b \sqrt{1 - T/T_c} $$
