## The London Equations [1]

A set of basic constitutive relations for superconductivity.

### London penetration depth

The characteristic length scale of the London equations and many derived models -- typically thought of as the magnetic field
penetration depth for bulk superconductors.

$$ \lambda_L^2 = \frac{m}{n_s \mu_0 e^2} $$

### Electrodynamics

The current dynamics for a superconductor in the London model are given by:

$$ \vec{J_s} = e n_s \vec{v} $$

where $n_s$ is the Cooper pair (superelectron) density;

$$ \vec{E} = \mu_0 \lambda_L^2 \frac{\partial \vec{J_s}}{\partial t} $$

$$ \nabla \times \vec{J_s} = -\frac{1}{\lambda_L^2} \vec{H} $$
